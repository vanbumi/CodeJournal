# Introduction to React

> React is a JavaScript framework, originally created by engineers at Facebook to solve the challenges involved when developing complex user interfaces with datasets that change overtime.

> React builds large-scale user interfaces with data that changes over time.

##### Two-way data binding

Application must contain views that listen to models, and then the views independently update their presentation based on either user interaction or the model changing. In a basic application this is not a noticeable bottleneck for performance, or more importantly, for developer productivity.

##### Core concept of React composition

	var TodoApp = React.createClass({
		render: function() {
			...
		}
	});
