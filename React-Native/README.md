#### Firebase Error

    Unable to resolve module `firebase` from `E:\workspace\reactnative\auth-app-expo\src\Main.js`: Module does not exist in the module map or in these directories:
      E:\workspace\reactnative\auth-app-expo\node_modules
    
    This might be related to https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/4968
    To resolve try the following:
      1. Clear watchman watches: `watchman watch-del-all`.
      2. Delete the `node_modules` folder: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`.
      3. Reset packager cache: `rm -fr $TMPDIR/react-*` or `npm start -- --reset-cache`.

**Solution**

1. Delete the `node_modules`. 
2. Install react 15.6.1 or latest.  
3. npm install.

**Another Error**

    Warning
    Warning: 'react' peer depencency missing. Run `npm ls` in E:\workspace\reactnative\auth-app-expo to see full warning.
    
    If there is an issue running your project, please run `npm install` in E:\workspace\reactnative\auth-app-expo and restart.     

**Solution 1**

    Back to change React v 16.0.0-alpha.12, restart xde. But check if fibase has instaled.

## Solution 2 from official expo

When you’re unable to load a bundle, look at the packager logs or the error message displayed in the Expo client to see if it’s related to the packager. If so, you should try clearing the packager’s state to reduce the chance the bug is related to a stale cache or corrupt process.

These instructions are for macOS and Linux, but the general ideas apply to Windows as well.

1. Stop XDE/exp, which should also stop the packager. Check your list of running processes to ensure these processes are not running.
2. Delete node_modules in your project.
    If your project depends on other local projects (e.g. has a file: URI in its dependencies), clear those local project’s node_modules directories too for good measure even though it’s probably unnecessary.
3. Clear your Yarn or npm cache, depending on which you’re using, with yarn cache clean or npm cache clean.
4. Run yarn or npm i to install your dependencies again.
5. Run watchman watch-del-all to clear Watchman’s state.
6. Kill the watchman daemon process.
7. Delete the packager’s cache directory with rm -fr $TMPDIR/react-*
8. Start XDE or exp, With exp, run : 

    exp r -c 
    

for good measure
    
And just to be sure, force quit the Expo client on your phone or simulator and re-open it.

or 
    npm start -- --reset-cache

#### syntaxerror: strict mode does not allow function declarations in a lexically nested statment.

Solution:

[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41058495/syntaxerror-strict-mode-does-not-allow-function-declarations-in-a-lexically-nes).
[Github Fb](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/11389)

I've found simple solution

1. Open node_modules\react-native\Libraries\Core\InitializeCore.js line 112

2. change function handleError(e, isFatal) to var handleError = function(e, isFatal)

3. then do npm start -- --reset-cache
   you can also check it in github issue above

3. For those who can't find the Core folder in the the react-native node_modules. You might be running a different version like I was, and found it here:

    node_modules\react-native\Libraries\JavaScriptAppEngine\Initialization\InitializeJavaScriptAppEngine.js

    line ~120
    

and change

    function handleError(e, isFatal) 
    to
    
    var handleError = function(e, isFatal)
    then do npm start -- --reset-cache

## Install New Ract version on RN

* Delete node modules 
* Delete react in package.json
* Install react 15.6.1 or latest
* And install all rest.

## Warning!

Setting a timer for a long period of time, i.e. multiple minutes, is a performance and correctness issue on Android as it keeps the timer module awake, and timers can only be called when the app is in the foreground. See https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12981 for more info. (Saw setTimeout with duration 111862ms)

Solution:

    console.ignoredYellowBox = [
       'Setting a timer'
    ]

Or Read: [Add support for AlarmManager in Timing to allow proper handling of long timers](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12981)
