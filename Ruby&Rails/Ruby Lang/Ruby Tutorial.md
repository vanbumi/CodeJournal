## Audience

This reference has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts related to Ruby Scripting languages.

## Prerequisites

Before you start doing practice with various types of examples given in this reference, I'm making an assumption that you are already aware about what is a computer program and what is a computer programming language.

## Execute Ruby Online

For most of the examples given in this tutorial you will find Try it option, so just make use of this option to execute your Ruby programs at the spot and enjoy your learning.

Try following example using Try it option available at the top right corner of the below sample code box âˆ’

## Interactive Ruby (IRb):

Interactive Ruby (IRb) provides a shell for experimentation. Within the IRb shell, you can immediately view expression results, line by line.

This tool comes along with Ruby installation so you have nothing to do extra to have IRb working.

Just type irb at your command prompt and an Interactive Ruby Session will start as given below:

	$irb
	irb 0.6.1(99/09/16)
	irb(main):001:0> def hello
	irb(main):002:1> out = "Hello World"
	irb(main):003:1> puts out
	irb(main):004:1> end
	nil
	irb(main):005:0> hello
	Hello World
	nil
	irb(main):006:0>
