##### Options for all Validations:
You can use the following options along with all the validations.

	:message => 'my own errormessage' Use this to print a custom error message in case of validation fails.

	:on => :create or :update This will be used in such cases where you want to perform validation only when record is being created or updated. So, if you use :create then this validation work only when there is a create operation on database.
